### Overview
 FerMentor is an electronic fermentation guide that allows users to create an account, view fermentation guides as well as publishing their own fermentation recepies. Our overall concept for the creation of this app was to build a platform and a community where people who are interested in learning how to ferment can start. As well as a platform for people who are masters at fermenting to be able to publish their own fermentation guides and allow others users to see and follow. Only if user has a FerMentor account they are able to view all the recipes available and be able to append them to their individual profile page.
